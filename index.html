            Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding
            challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let
            me
            emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5
            required
            projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on
            the
            sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is
            what
            makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor!

                The entire curriculum should be a series of projects

            No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one
            test at a time, as you build up a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you
            build
            up projects and your own understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons
            and
            projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into projects. And there's plenty of repetition to
            help
            you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and
            packing
            them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People
            will
            be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after
            another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they
            experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that
            sense of
            forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

            <h3 class="blue-heading">A Brief History</h3>
            <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="blue-heading">V1 - 2014</h4>
                    <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and
                        Stanford's Database Class.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="blue-heading">V2 - 2015</h4>
                    <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="blue-heading">V3 - 2015</h4>
                    <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course
                        for these).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="blue-heading">V4 - 2016</h4>
                    <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data
                        Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own
                        challenges. For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="blue-heading">V5 - 2017</h4>
                    <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="blue-heading">V6 - 2018</h4>
                    <p>We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum
                        improvement to date.</p>
